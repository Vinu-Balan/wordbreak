# wordbreak
The dictionary file is a text file with words seperated by comma (",").
The other text files have one sentence in each line.
The wordbreak.py program prints the output to the output.txt file.
The comparision.py program compares the sentences in the output.txt file and in the expected_output.txt file. It prints the number of matching sentences.
The two programs work by taking the file names as arguments from the user.
